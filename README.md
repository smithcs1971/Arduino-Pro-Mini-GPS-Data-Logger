Studying the movement of wildlife is essential for understanding their biology, role in the ecosystem and other important issues, including the ecology of any disease they may host. Over the decades many telemetry devices have been used to study the movement of wildlfe, inlcuding; radio, satellite and most recently GPS. However, this technology is often expensive and beyond the scope of students, citizen scientists and other interested parties.

In 2014 we developed and deployed a prototype wireless GPS datalogger (http://fritzing.org/projects/wireless-gps-datalogger) on flying-foxes (the worlds largest bats) and gained useful data.

The prototype was glued to the back of the flying-fox using a medical grade skin adhesive. Previously, this glue had been used to attach commercial wireless GPS data loggers to bats for periods of up to 12 days.

The protype was succesful in capturing movement data of the flying-fox. It revealed that the bat left its roost at 17:59, travelled 30 km south to its foraging area. The next morning, the bat flew the return trip to the roost and arrived home at 5:34, just before sunrise. A total distance of over 60 km (almost 40 miles) in a single night.

Whilst the prototype proved successful, it was still relatively too large for the flying-fox and was shed soon after the first night. A smaller and more efficient wireless GPS data logger was required and is presented in this repository.
