# Arduino-Pro-Mini-Wireless-GPS-Data-Logger
Build yourself a wireless GPS datalogger for use on wildlife.

Studying the movement of wildlife is essential for understanding their biology, their role in the ecosystem and other important issues, including the ecology of any disease they may be host to. Over the decades many telemtry devices have been used to study the movement of wildlfe, inlcuding; radio, telemetry and most recently GPS data loggers. However, this technology is often expensive and beyond the scope of students, citizen scientists and other interested parties.

In 2014 we developed and deployed a prototype wireless GPS datalogger (http://fritzing.org/projects/wireless-gps-datalogger) on flying-foxes (the worlds largest bats) and gained useful data.
